In a modern world where technology is advancing at a fast pace, many industries have chosen to adopt some form of technology to improve their products and services. Sports are no exception. In tennis, the famous Hawk-Eye System has already brought a lot of benefits to the professional field. Nonetheless, these benefits are not readily accessible for day-to-day consumers. I was involved in team to produce an augmented reality and tennis performance analysis application. 

Our project concerns building an Android app which allows the users to track their performance and to obtain statistics of their different game aspects. We extended an existing preliminary prototype provided by the industrial partner. However, the prototype contained was found to have robustness issues, and its detection mechanism was very inefficient which often caused the frame rate to drop significantly.

    Left: field test of enhanced line detection, environmental lighting no long severely affects the detection accuracy and frame rate does not change significantly. Right: field test recording of ball serves, detection and tracking are able to ignore background which contains many sphere shape objects.

Through great team effort and collaborations, we were able to address the early issues in the application and enhance it with additional functionalities that pleased the stakeholders. The details of this application are omitted due to the information non-disclosure agreement. We received unanimously positive feedback from the project advisor in the department and were invited for further collaboration with the industrial partner.
