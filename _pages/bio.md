He was awarded an MEng degree in Computing with a specialist in Artificial Intelligence at Imperial College London. At Imperial College London, he received training on topics including Computational Logic, Statistics, Machine Learning and Complexity Theory.

Lun Ai specialises in the theory and methods of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) in particular Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL). He has strong interests in Explainable AI and the theory of machine learning comprehensibility. He has been supported by the UKâ€™s EPSRC Human-Like Computing network and the TAILOR network (under EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme). His recent works have focused on investigating constraints on explanatory beneficiality and harmfulness of symbolic machine-learned theory in the scope of MIL, sequential human-machine interactions and effects of the explanatory teaching curriculum.
