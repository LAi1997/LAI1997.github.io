Welcome! I am a doctoral student and research assistant in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London. I have been supervised by [Stephen Muggleton](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/shm/) (primary) and [Alessandra Russo](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.russo).

`Research topic`: Effects of symbolic machine-learned explanations on human comprehension in machine-human teaching.

`Specialisation`: Theory and methods of [Inductive Logic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic_programming)(ILP), in particular [Meta-Interpretive Learning](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~shm/Papers/rulemlabs.pdf) (MIL).

`Recent work`: Constraints on explanatory effectiveness of symbolic machine learned theory; Ssequential human-machine teaching interactions.

`Current project`: [TAILOR](https://tailor-network.eu/) in EU, a network for AI scientists in learning, optimisation, reasoning and social scientists. We have great collaborations with the [Cognitive System group](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/cogsys/schmid/) at the University of Bamberg.

I enjoy exercising and a variety of sports (basketball, swimming, badminton, etc). I was the captain of the Imperial Mandarin Basketball team and organised various sport events across the UK.
