Thank you for visiting!

I am currently a research assistant and a doctoral student in the department of computing at Imperial College London. I have been supervised by Prof. Stephen Muggleton (primary) and Prof. Alessandra Russo (secondary) to work on "Optimising Comprehensibility of Machine Learned Logic Programs". Below are **highlights** from my bio:

`Interest and focus`: Explainable AI and theory of machine learning comprehensibility.

`Specialisation`: Theory and methods of [Inductive Logic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic_programming)(ILP), in particular [Meta-Interpretive Learning](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~shm/Papers/rulemlabs.pdf) (MIL).

`Recent work`: Constraints on explanatory beneficiality and harmfulness of symbolic machine learned theory, sequential human-machine interactions.

`Current project`: [TAILOR](https://tailor-network.eu/) in EU, a network for AI scientists in learning, optimisation, reasoning and social scientists. We have great collaborations with the [Cognitive System group](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/cogsys/schmid/) at the University of Bamberg.

In spare time, I enjoy regular exercise and a variety of sports (swimming, basketball, running, gymming, etc). I have been the leader of Imperial Mandarin Basketball for three years and organised various in and off college events across the country.
I grew up in Beijing, China and love making Chinese dishes.
