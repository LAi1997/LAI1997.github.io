I am postdoc in the Synthetic Biology (<ins>[Baldwin](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.baldwin)</ins>) Lab at Imperial College London. It excites me to consider AI's possibilities in reshaping people's lives and our understanding of the world. 

`Interests`:
My career mission is to develop sustainable and user-friendly AI technologies that can help us tackle pressing scientific and societal challenges. I specialise in the theory and methods of logic-based AI (Inductive Logic Programming, <ins>[ILP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic_programming)</ins>) with a passion in eXplainable AI (<ins>[XAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence)</ins>), human-performance-enhancing AI and autonomous discovery systems.

`Networks`:
- UKRI BBSRC <ins>[AI-4-EB](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/236657/new-uk-wide-ai-engineering-biology-consortium/)</ins> (2022 - 2024)
- EU Horizon <ins>[TAILOR](https://tailor-network.eu/)</ins> (2020 - 2023)
- UKRI EPSRC Network+ <ins>[Human-Like Computing](http://hlc.doc.ic.ac.uk/)</ins> (2019 - 2024)

`Doctoral research`: 
I built Ultra-Strong Machine Learning (human-AI partnership) frameworks and characterised properties to enhance human learning via operational approaches and ILP systems. I obtained my doctoral degree under the supervision of Prof. <ins>[Stephen Muggleton](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WxJXT2MAAAAJ&hl=en)</ins>, in collaboration with Prof. (<ins>[Ute Schmid](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/cogsys/schmid/)</ins>) from University of Bamberg.
