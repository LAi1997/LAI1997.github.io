I am postdoc in the Computational Bioinformatics Lab of Dept. Computing at Imperial College London.
It excites me to consider AI's possibilities in reshaping people's lives and our understanding of the world.

My career mission is to develop sustainable and user-friendly AI technologies that can help us tackle pressing scientific and societal challenges.
I specialise in the theory and methods of logic-based AI (Inductive Logic Programming, <ins>[ILP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic_programming)</ins>) with a passion in eXplainable AI (<ins>[XAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence)</ins>), human-performance-enhancing AI and autonomous discovery systems.

`Research experience`: 
- BBSRC AI-4-EB (<ins>[link](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/236657/new-uk-wide-ai-engineering-biology-consortium/)</ins>) (Current)
- EU Horizon TAILOR (<ins>[link](https://tailor-network.eu/)</ins>)
- EPSRC Human-Like Computing (<ins>[link](http://hlc.doc.ic.ac.uk/)</ins>)

`Collaborators`: 
- Prof. Ute Schmid, University of Bamberg (<ins>[Cognitive System Group](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/cogsys/schmid/)</ins>)
- Prof. Geoff Baldwin, Imperial College London (<ins>[Department of Life Science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.baldwin)</ins>)

`PhD research`: 
Supervised by Prof. Stephen Muggleton (<ins>[link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WxJXT2MAAAAJ&hl=en)</ins>), my doctoral research focused on characterising properties that affect the human understanding of ILP systems via operational approaches and build frameworks to facilitate better human performance.
