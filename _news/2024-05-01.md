I received my PhD degree in Computing Research. Here is my thesis on "[Effects of Machine-Learned Logic Theories on Human Comprehension in Machine-Human Teaching](https://doi.org/10.25560/112264)"</ins>.
A big thank to Prof. Stephen Muggleton for the support and all examiners for their helpful feedback.
