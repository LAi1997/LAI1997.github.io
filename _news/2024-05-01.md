I received my PhD degree in Computing Research. Here is my thesis on "[Effects of Machine-Learned Logic Theories on Human Comprehension in Machine-Human Teaching](https://doi.org/10.25560/112264)".
I truly appreciate Prof. Stephen Muggleton for the amazing support and examiners (Prof. Francesca Toni and Prof. Nick Chater) for their insightful feedback.
